I had planned to implement various cool features like opening directories in the file provider or supporting openrc, but all that took too long, so here's some accumulated bug fixes.

Fixed bugs:
- VNC being really really slow. It's now just slow, rather than really really slow.
- Deadlock that showed up for me when doing git clone
- Memory leak for every exited process
- Rare deadlock when running x11vnc
- A few emulator fixes for Java
