Fixed bugs:
- Keyboard hiding not working at all
  - This was caused by the extra key hiding setting, and fixed by reverting it. I'll figure out what was up in the next release.
- sqrt(0) returning NaN
- Hang when any iOSFS syscall tries to return an error

This is a small bug fix release so here's the previous changelog for your convenience:

New stuff:
- Most Go prebuilt binaries iSH will work (such as ngrok)
- iOS file picker works on iOS 11 and 12 (thanks @kkk669)
- Character under the cursor is now visible in the background color
- You can press multiple keys while holding down the control button
- There's a new setting that hides the extra keys if a hardware keyboard is connected

Fixed bugs:
- Frequent hangs when trying to use iOS mounted filesystems
- Emacs not working at all, reporting "Failed select: Invalid argument"
- Ruby crashing when you press ctrl-c
- mount command hanging when you dismiss the folder picker by swiping it away (thanks @kkk669)
- Rare "error -2" on initial installation (hopefully this is actually fixed, I've never been able to reproduce it)
- Emacs printing negative numbers as NaN
